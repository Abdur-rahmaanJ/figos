#### ive been thinking about the tasks i perform most often in 
#### bash, and of making a few utilities to create shortcuts.
#### bash is a great language i use every day, though im not an 
#### expert. so these utilities will not replace bash, but for 
#### me they augment it.

#### they can also be used to teach coding.
#### the first of these utilities is called arrlen, which takes 
#### stdin and returns the length of each line. yes, you can do 
#### this with a bash one-liner; ive chosen fig.

# p=$(echo hello | arrlen | awk '{print $1}') ; echo $p
# 5
 
# $ for p in $(echo "hello there how are you?") ; do echo $p ; done | arrlen
# 5 hello
# 5 there
# 3 how
# 3 are
# 4 you?
# $
 
function re(z p)
f=z ; split(f p) ; join(f "") ; return(f)
fig

forin (p stdin)
cr=13 ; chr
lf=10 ; chr
z=p ; re(z cr) ; re(z lf)
p=z ; len ; prints ; " " ; prints
p=z ; print
next
